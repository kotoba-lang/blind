;; Regenerate the `golden-blind` / `golden-seal` vectors in
;; `test/blind/vectors.cljc`.
;;
;; This script deliberately does NOT use `blind.core`. It computes the same
;; composition with Node's `node:crypto` — a third implementation,
;; independent of both `javax.crypto` (what the JVM suite exercises) and
;; Web Crypto / `crypto.subtle` (what the ClojureScript suite exercises).
;; If all three agree, the golden values are evidence; if the goldens were
;; produced by one of the implementations under test, they would only be a
;; recording of that implementation's behaviour.
;;
;;   npm run golden
;;
;; It prints EDN to stdout. It does not rewrite the vectors file — compare
;; the output to what is checked in by eye, so that a change has to be
;; noticed rather than absorbed.
;;
;; Key material below is the public test fixture from
;; `test/blind/vectors.cljc`. Nothing here reads a key from the
;; environment, and nothing here generates one.
